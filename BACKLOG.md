# SidebarLeft and SidebarRight Padding or Margin Bug

Regardless if main changes, sidebarLeft and sidebarRight should always have padding or margin.

# Main UI Lines

Main has extra lines pointing down. Not sure why.

# SidebarLeft and SidebarRight Height

These are full page height. Not sure if that is the best option.
Perhaps add content or make this smaller.

# Light Mode / Dark Mode.

This functionality is not working anymore.
